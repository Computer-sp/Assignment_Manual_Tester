Test Cases for Login:
1. Verify that the login page loads successfully.
2. Verify that the user can enter their username and password.
3. Verify that the 'Login' button is enabled when both fields are filled.
4. Verify that the user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
5. Verify error messages for invalid username or password.

Validation for each field:
- Username: Alphanumeric.
- Password: Matches the registered password.

Bugs:
- Valid credentials not allowing login.
- 'Login' button enabled with only one field filled.
